#  Seasonal Flu Vaccines
*Prepared By Kit N., Lucas F. and Navpreet N.* <br> *12 January 2022*

## Introduction

This exercise predicts whether individuals will receive their seasonal flu vaccine by fitting machine learning model to the phone survey data collected in the United States National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NFHS)[^1]. We consider three machine learning models:

* Model 1: Support vector classifier learning model
* Model 2: Random forest classsifier learning model
* Model 3: Deep neutral network model

We then compare the performance of each model to determine which has sufficient predictive power. *To add - discuss performance metric and what will indicate stronger performance*

[^1]: The NFHS was one-time survey designed to monitor vaccination during 2009-2010 flu season in response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. For further information, refer to [U.S. National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NFHS)](https://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20140511031000/http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nis/about_nis.htm#h1n1)


## Data
### Data used
The NFHS data was provided courtesy of the United States National Center for Health Statistics for a [data science practice competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/) hosted by DrivenData. Each survey respondents where asked whether they had received H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines and additional questions about themselves such as social, economic and demographic background, opinions on risks of illness and vaccine effectiveness, and behaviours towards mitigating tranmission. 

Given the focus of this exercise is on seasonal flu vaccine prediction, H1N1 data included in the NFHS data is dropped and not used for fitting machine learning model.
