[^1]: This is a active practice data science competition hosted by DrivenData. The competition is titled ["Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines"](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/).

## Introduction

This exercise predicts whether individuals will receive their seasonal flu vaccine by fitting machine learning model to the phone survey data collected in the United States National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NFHS)[^2]. We consider three machine learning models:

* Model 1: Support vector classifier learning model
* Model 2: Random forest classsifier learning model
* Model 3: Deep neutral network model

We then compare the performance of each model to determine which has sufficient predictive power. *To add - discuss performance metric and what will indicate stronger performance*

[^2]: The NFHS was one-time survey designed to monitor vaccination during 2009-2010 flu season in response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
