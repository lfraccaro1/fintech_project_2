#  Seasonal Flu Vaccines[^1]

[^1]: This is a active practice data science competition hosted by DrivenData. The competition is titled ["Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines"](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/).

This exercise attempts to predict whether individuals will receive their seasonal flu vaccine by understanding the phone survey data collected in the United States National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NFHS)[^2]. We fit three different machine learning models to the survey data and compare the performance of each model to determine which has sufficient predictive power. 
* Model 1: Support vector classifier learning model
* Model 2: Decision tree model
* Model 3: Deep neutral network model

[^2]: The NFHS was one-time survey designed to monitor vaccination during 2009-2010 flu season in response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
